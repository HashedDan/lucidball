            <p>
                LucidBall is free to use for anyone anywhere because the purpose is not to make money, but enrich the experience of basketball fans.
                However, it does require significant funds to keep LucidBall running and up to date.
                I am covering the costs personally, but because I am currently earning $0 for running LucidBall, it is challenging to do so.
                If you are able to give any amount of money, it goes a long way to making sure that we are always delivering up-to-date, accurate data and visualizations.
                (It also helps me sleep better at night.)
